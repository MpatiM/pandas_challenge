    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to analyze school data, student data, and the combination of both, several dataframes were created to create summary tables for easy analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following dataframes were created:\n",
    "- __District Summary__: displays the total amount of schools, students, budget, the average math and reading scores, and overall passing percentage.\n",
    "- __School Summary__: displays the district type of the school, total student amount, total budget, average math and reading scores, and overall passing percentage for each school listed.\n",
    "- __Highest Performing Schools__: displays the top five performing schools by overall passing percentage.\n",
    "- __Lowest Performing Schools__: displays the bottom five performing schools by overall passing percentage.\n",
    "- __Math Scores by Grade__: displays average math scores by grade.\n",
    "- __Reading Scores by Grade__: displays average reading scores by grade.\n",
    "- __School Spending Summary__: displays the spending ranges per student, the score averages and overall passing percentage.\n",
    "- __School Size Summary__: displays categories of school size, the score averages and overall passing percentage.\n",
    "- __School District Type Summary__: dispalys district types, the score averages and overall passing percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "After analyzing the data, commonalities could be seen based on the school district type. Overall, Charter schools have a higher passing rate compared to District schools when looking at the district summary. While looking at the top performing schools, all top 5 are Charter school types. To further support this observation, the bottom 5 performing schools are District school types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Medium size schools and small size schools have similar overall passing rates but are higher than that of larger size schools. When looking deeper, majority of large size schools are district schools, further emphasizing that district schools perform poorly in comparison to charter schools. When looking at the budget and spending ranges per student, it does not seem to have a major impact on average math and reading scores but spending ranges <$585 per student have the highest overall passing. This can also be linked to the observation that schools with higher budgets are also large sized schools and have a higher spending range per student in order to accommodate student amount.\r",
